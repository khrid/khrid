## Hey ! Welcome to my Github profile ðŸ˜€

I am a IT enthusiast currently working as Senior Quality Engineer for a Swiss insurance company. I am also studying at [HES-SO Valais/Wallis](http://www.hevs.ch) for my [BSc in Business Information Technology](https://www.hevs.ch/en/hautes-ecoles/school-of-management/business-information-technology/bachelor-s-degree-in-business-information-technology-200049/). During my free time, I like to learn new things about various subjects! I also like to ride my motorcycle and explore my beautiful country.
